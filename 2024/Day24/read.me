sample 5 is the 6 bit clean adder
sample 6 is the 3 bit clean adder
sample 7 is the single transpose on a 3 bit adder
sample 8 is the double transpose on a 6 bit adder



Target Solution:
    # [('qjb', 'gvw'), ('jgc', 'z15'), ('drg', 'z22'),  ('jbp', 'z35'), ]

    # rules = swap_rules(rules, 'qjb', 'gvw')
    # rules = swap_rules(rules, 'jgc', 'z15')
    # rules = swap_rules(rules, 'drg','z22')
    # rules = swap_rules(rules, 'jbp','z35')
